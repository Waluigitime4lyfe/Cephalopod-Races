# Cephalopod Species

Concept by Waweeg
Not implemented

## Overview

Cephalopods are a race of squids and octopuses that use moisture to breathe instead of air sources.
My ideas on their design plan follow two essentials: A "actions over words" play style, and utilizing the bizarre nature and biology of real world cephalopods to bring them unique weaknesses and strengths.

(More specific details at the end)


## Background

Squid faced aliens have been a staple in sci fi and fantasy for a long time. While I've never played space station 13, some wiki's talk about a humanoid with squid genetics being playable. This along with the squiddy cosmetic in 14 show their inclusion wouldn't be far fetched. Obsessed with cephalopods since childhood, I wholeheartedly believe the most intelligent invertebrates in real life should get some representation.


## Design

A way to put it bluntly, cephalopods follow a glass cannon philosophy of usefulness and uselessness.
All things about them are designed to be an equal scale that measures their survival skills to their physical weakness.


#### Unique
The cephalopods odd survivability makes them seem more in common to space carp, but their intelligence and tentacles make them useful crew members. They're brainy, have their own way of communicating (more on that later), and have a silly set of abilities.

#### Odd, but balanced
Their benefits outnumber their problems, but the severity of both let them teeter between being a little better or a lot worse than humans. The weird glares from coworkers as you kneel in anguish in front of the empty water cooler may sting, but the pain "washes away" after you become the hero for braving the spaced medbay and getting crit patients out alive. Not always the social type, they're rather difficult to be in positions of power.

#### Technical
 They are built primarily for hands on jobs but are also intended to be very efficient in smarter lines of work.
Of course, nobody is intended to only play a single job or few jobs as them. All sorts of jobs will bring different situations they'll have to get through, some only they might have to face without the help of others. 


## Specifics 

- There will be some system indication/display at Character Creation to inform the player what to expect (presumably, this system will also serve to provide basic info about other playable species)
  - Should use (or be integrated into) the Guidebook

- Cephalopods get oxygen from drinking water, or getting water on their skin
  - Examining one will say if they're Very Hydrated, Well Hydrated, Hydrated, Somewhat Dehydrated, Dehydrated.
    - They'll retain moisture for 20 minutes after max water absorbed, decreasing in these rankings as the time ticks down.
        - They'll also get slower in movement the less water in them.
    - The thirst warning activating means to immediately search out water, or they'll start suffocating after 60 seconds and immediately go critical.

- To revive one, the defibs need to be used three times, once for each heart. 
- They rot 2x faster than normal
- Rotting cephalopods release a toxic cloud of ammonia (Giant squids in real life contain a lethal amount in their flesh)

- Cephalopod blood is blue and contains copper. Their blood can be exchanged without problems with other blue blooded races.
- Their brain is a donut shape with multiple mini brain stems (octopus arms have their own autonomy in real life with these stems) branching from it, it's referred to as brains in game.
- When gibbed, they'll drop their gills, brains, stomach, eyes, ink sac, and hearts. 

Clothing gimmicks
- Naked, their sprite will be flowing as well as the diona, but won't actually have a body. 
  - Their "body" is just their tentacles reaching all the way to the floor
  - They slip into clothes to show cultural respect to the others, even if it's not on their real body.
  - They cannot wear boots, gloves, or masks.

- Passive: Cephalopods have a mag boots effect at all times, with their suction cups adhering to everything they walk across.
 - They can still slip on puddles, and may actively do so to moisturize on the go.
 - Passive: They don't drop handheld items when slipping, also from their suction cups.
-Their suction cup passives will disable, releasing their tight grip on the ground and items if damaged 10% with any damage.

They are fast and crafty in combat, but rather squishy
- In combat mode their unarmed tentacles only deal 3 damage at a slow pace, but their pull is dominating.
  - Pulling someone will overpower them unless they do an input to escape from your grip (like escaping a pocket as a small animal)
  - This grip can let you get away with a lot in the short time you have someone or something stuck. 
  - Taking any damage will cause you to instantly stop pulling, even being hit with something that does 0 damage.
- They take +25% Piercing, and +10% more Slash damage than others
  - (To emulate how effective spearing is on sealife, and the classical depictions of cutting off tentacles of sea beasts.)

- They are 2% faster than humans at max hydration. 

- They succumb to low pressure sickness and go critical in 100 seconds if they can't get out of the room, but only if exposed to it suddenly. 
   -If they wear a hardsuit with a helmet on first, enter the low pressure area, and then remove their helmet or suit, they'll acclimate to it and can survive even out in space (until they eventually freeze to death) 
   - They'll have to reacclimate to re enter the normal pressured areas by repeating the process. 

- High temperature environments are particularly dangerous in long term exposure, as they spent their early lives in the coldest depths and warm tropical shallows. 

### Diet
A predatory race that can handle things like bread and cheese, but requires meat for actual nutrients. And of course, need to watch what fluids they drink or absorb.

- Still weak to any poisons humans are
- Can eat raw meat without ill effects
- Can only eat meat, other foods will build very small toxins that will need to be treated if too much is eaten.
- Alcohols are poisonous to them, so they can't head to the bar for something to breathe. 
- Sodas will still quench them, but not as efficiently as regular water.
- Adding salt to water will make it more potent in keeping them saturated.

### Color changing
Cephalopods over the years have gotten better at using their chromatophores that they can show how they're feeling without needing the ability to speak. 
The color wheel in the character customization menu will not let people choose colors that are too desaturated, but every color other than white and very light versions of colors is available.

- Cephs will lose or gain their color saturation with each level of water contained in them.
   -They also lose color depending on their damage.
- A dead one will be pale white. 

- When using the chat, the game will automatically make your message grey like an rp action. You'll be limited to only the first three words you send in this process
  - (The Cephalopod has its head display: Hi there.) (The Cephalopod has it's arms display: How are you?)
  - They cannot whisper with their skin, so their communication is almost like being mute
     - Choosing to be mute as a cephalopod, be it option or being the mime, will remove your color abilities. You'll also appear pale white at all times as well. Doctors will constantly rush up to you asking if you're fine.


### Activatable abilities

I've explained the system of hydrading and the three passive suction cup abilities. These are actions the cephs can choose to do at a few costs.

- Regenerate
  -Using this They can slowly heal back 5% brute and 10% Pierce and slash damage dealt to them at the cost of immediately becoming hungry. This won't be available on an empty stomach.
  (-I was told not to write about it by a friend, but eventually one day surgery and de-limbing will be added to the game. Cephalopods, if missing part of their "body" (the arms that are where arms legs and a torso will be) will regenerate one of their limbs as well. If decapitated, the first limb generated back would be the torso tentacles.)

- Siphon jet
At the cost of a level of water in them, cephalopods can jet backwards 1 tile in rooms, while making a full size puddle on the ground.
This will also spray the person in front of them with the water.

  -Ink

-Another action is to make ink, selecting to make ink will make the next Siphon jet into ink at the cost of a little hunger.
 -Ink will significantly hinder the vision of someone hit with it until they can wash it off.
 -Generating ink can also make you be able to write on papers without a pen, and can also craft a crayon or pens with it if the ink is collected in a container.



# Conclusive notes for now

- Intended for salvage and paramedic jobs initially, but is versatile as any role.
- Terrifying as a syndicate due to it's slippery nature, little need for small talk, tight grips, and void survival, but easily put down.
- Makes a satisfying suction cup noise when walking and letting go of objects

I'd die of happiness at any squids, octopi, nautilus, etc becoming playable. 
I'm not versed in code, but I am and know a few artists, and have a creative mind. If developers need my help if they decided this is good enough to add, I'll gladly work with them.
